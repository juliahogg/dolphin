                <p>Hello! I am a computer science major with a minor in environmental studies. I am also a member of the Paladin Regiment and a
                    student worker in the university libraries and Center for Academic Success. In my spare time, I like to bake, watch terrible
                    movies (the harder it is to watch, the better. Lifetime movies, direct-to-tv sequels, Netflix originals, that kind of thing),
                    and crochet.</p>
